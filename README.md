# Toy experiment to compare Conventional and Deep Image Model for Homography estimation

This code is a assignment for Intelligence Integrated System class, April 2020

This code is writen by jupyter notebook with keras and OpenCV:
- Deep Image model:
reimplemented from [DeTone D, Malisiewicz T, Rabinovich A. Deep image homography estimation[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.03798, 2016.]
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03798
You can get a pretrained model from here:https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B88aZDadyYr8TTBSY3JvYTVKVnc

- And some conventional methods in OpenCV library

## Dependencies
+ OpenCV 3.4.2
+ Keras
+ TensorFlow
